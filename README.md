# Procedual-Generation

  This is an algorithim I wrote in java to procedually generate a dungeon from an array of rooms. The generator works be recursivley adding a room on each side of the current room that has a door. Minimum and maximum sizes can be specified but the maximum may be exceeded slightly, because after the maximum is reached the generator will spawn only end point rooms.
